## Spaces and Rooms

Jupiter Broadcasting's Rooms are organized into groups called "spaces".

You can find all the Jupiter Broadcasting rooms [in this space][jb-space], or join the sub-spaces you are interested in:

- [Community][com-space] (this sub-space is the most active at the time of writing)
- [Colony Meetups][meet-space]
- [Coder Radio][cr-space]
- [Linux Action News][lan-space]
- [LINUX Unplugged][lup-space]
- [Self-Hosted][sh-space]

## Element

For any of these links, you will be prompted to choose a Matrix client to proceed with.
Element will be the top option, and is the recommended client for users new to Matrix.
If you have not created a Matrix account, you will be guided through creation on Matrix.org's homeserver.

## Other Clients

Matrix.org maintains [a list of Matrix clients][mx-clients].

Be warned that not all clients have support for spaces.
You may need to log into Element, and join your desired rooms there first.
